# Linear regression with for loops and matrices calculation
-
In the [live video session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwwWVAgJBcM&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7mfQDsEcmxxtxgFEZg0bW-&index=13), Sirag uses for-loops to calculate the error and the gradient steps for the linear regression demo. It is a better and straight forward way for beginners to understand how it works. Trying to contribute more on what Sirag taught us, I implemented the error and gradient steps calculations in matrices and compared the performance of the two implementations. It makes a huge difference when the dataset grows!
